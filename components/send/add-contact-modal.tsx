// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within the component's logic and are likely related to
// form validation or data processing.  Without the original code, I can only provide a placeholder
// declaration.  A proper solution would involve inspecting the original code and determining the
// correct type and initial value for each variable.

// Placeholder declarations:
const brevity = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type
const it = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type
const is = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type
const correct = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type
const and = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type

// The rest of the component code would follow here, using the declared variables.
// For example:
// if (is && correct) {
//   // ... do something ...
// }

// Note: This is a placeholder solution.  The actual implementation will depend on the
// content of the original 'components/send/add-contact-modal.tsx' file.
